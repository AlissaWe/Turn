# Turn
Turn is a basic turn-based RPG game written in C++ for Windows. 

## History
I wrote this game almost 5 years ago, and uploading it to GitHub was my first experience with open source. Now, I want to give back to the community for [Hacktoberfest 2017](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and encourage everyone, regardless of programming skills or knowledge, to contribute! :)
